Uniprogy's [Couponic](http://www.uniprogy.com) is a Groupon clone based on the [Yii framework](http://www.yiiframework.com).

This is a small yet-to-grow set of Couponic tutorials.

There is already a Tutorials section within Couponic's forums but I opted to Github
as the more natural way to share code.
